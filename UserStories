Ten user stories:

1. As a user, I want to view the open hours for each drop-off site,
   so that I can be sure that I won't waste my time going to one of the sites and found it closed.
2. As a user, I want to view the inventory at a drop-off site by categories to
   find the items I want faster and more accurately.
3. As a manager, I want the app to send me an warning when a category of goods (e.g. shoes, books etc) 
   is low in inventory at a drop-off site for a long tiem so that I can redistribute some of that kinds of goods
   from a nearby drop-off site to that site.
