Ten user stories:

1. As a user, I want to view the open hours for each drop-off site,
   so that I can be sure that I won't waste my time going to one of the sites and found it closed.
2. As a user, I want to view the inventory at a drop-off site by categories to
   find the items I want faster and more accurately.
3. As a manager, I want the app to send me an warning when a category of goods (e.g. shoes, books etc) 
   is low in inventory at a drop-off site for a long tiem so that I can redistribute some of that kinds of goods
   from a nearby drop-off site to that site.
4.As a location employee, I want to be able to update the values of items donated at my specific location, 
   so that users can be better informed before coming to a location.
5. As a user, I want to be able to update my password so that I can keep my account more secure
6. As an admin, I want to be able to unlock accounts if a user enters his password incorrect more than 3 times, 
   so that users have the ability to enter the system incase they have forgotten the password.
7. As a user, I want to be able to search items by location, so that I can save time and go the nearest possible location for a specific item.
8. As a manager, I want the app to give me the data to donation per day for a given month at a specific location, so that
   I can analyze the months when donations are lows and redistribute goods accordingly.
9. As a user, I want the app show all locations close to a given location, so that I can donate something quickly.
10. As an admin, I want to be able to remove users, so that some users who have misused the app no longer have access to it.

P.S. I have done 3/10. I will choose one from mine to expand as my individual portion of M4 - Jie
